# Quantization without Tears (CVPR 2025)

Implementation of **QwT**, a simple, fast, and general approach to network quantization that ‚Äúadds no tears‚Äù to your workflow. QwT augments any PTQ model with lightweight linear compensation layers to recover information lost during quantization .

## üöÄ Features

- **Fast**: closed‚Äêform compensation parameters can be computed on a small calibration set in under 2 minutes.  
- **Accurate**: outperforms standard PTQ methods without any back‚Äêprop.  
- **Simple**: zero task‚Äêspecific hyperparameters; only a few linear layers (`W, b`) per block.  
- **General**: applies to CNNs (ResNet), Transformers (ViT, Swin), detection (Mask R-CNN, DETR), segmentation, multi‚Äêmodal (CLIP), generative (DiT) and LLMs (LLaMA).  
- **Practical**: integrates seamlessly with TensorRT or any existing INT8/PTQ pipeline.
